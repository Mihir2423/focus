## How It Works

The extension uses Chrome's webRequest API to intercept navigation requests. The timer logic runs in the background script, ensuring it continues to operate even when the popup is closed. When the Pomodoro timer is active, any attempt to visit a blocked website will be redirected to a blocking page that shows the remaining time and provides information about the focus session.

Once the timer completes, website access is automatically restored.

## Troubleshooting

If websites are not being blocked:

1. Make sure the Pomodoro timer is running (the status should show "Focus Time")
2. Check that you've added the correct website URLs to the blocked list
3. Try reloading the extension:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Find "Pomodoro Website Blocker"
   - Click the refresh icon

## Privacy

This extension stores your blocked website list locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.

## Development

To modify this extension:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes
